# Episode 3 - Annotations

This episode, we discussed annotations: what their original intend was, what they are used for now. But also the pro's and con's, 
the good and bad practices.

Some code examples illustrating our views can be found in this repository. To clearify the examples, tests can be found 
in the test [folder](./src/test)
